This directory will contain all files in relation to FRET explicitly (e.g. import and export files)

## Demonstrative files

The FretDemoFiles directory contains all the files that are being used for testing in the work-in-progress project.

Of these files there are files that work as intended and are operational (_OP).
Files that are not operational (_XOP) or have an error message to their name (_ERR) will be documented here:

| File | Error message |
